 OVERVIEW BRIEF:
 USED MERN STACK FOR ENTIRE PROJECT.USED REDUX FOR STATE MANAGEMENT AND HOOKS AS COMPONENTS.USED AXIOS TO MAKE REQUESTS AND USED JS-COOKIE TO STORE CART DATA IN LOCAL STORAGE.
 WHENEVER USER MAKES HIS ICE CREAM IT IS DISPLAYED JUST BELOW THE MODAL.SO THE USER CAN ADD THAT INTO CART BY CHANGING QUANTITY.USER CAN ADD MULTIPLE ICECREAMS INTO CART.
 ONCE IT IS DONE HE CAN CHECKOUT WHERE HE NEED TO FILL HIS OWN INFORMATION AND THEN ORDER IS PLACED SUCCESFULLY AND USER GETS HIS ORDER SLIP.
